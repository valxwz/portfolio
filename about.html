                            <span class="highlight highlight-main">I first dabbled in product design in my junior year at IUB. </span> Thanks to<a href="https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?profile_id=298](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?profile_id=298"> Professor Martin A. Siegel</a> gave us a great introduction,  I was so fascinated by this idea of user-centered design. Since then, I've continued utilizing college resources to learn and practice HCI Design. Upon graduation, I had a software engineer offer and it was too late to look for another design job. As a newbie fresh out of college, I decided to try out work first. Well, <span class="highlight highlight-main">the more I was working as a software engineer, the more I want to switch to the UX design field. </span>Don't get me wrong. The dev team was great but the work didn't fit my personality. I'm a people person and love to learn from talking with others. UX design is a perfect field where I can think of people, talk with people and learn from people. </p>
                            <p>After going to UX Meetups, talking to professionals, and listening to podcasts, I settled my mind of switching my career path and <span class="highlight highlight-main">quitting my job to join UMich master program.</span> Looking back, it was the best decision I ever made. It was a hardcore 2-year program where we practiced UX design with real clients, and expanded my knowledge in not just UX, but also Data Analysis and Marketing Analysis. </p>
                            <p>Working as a product designer <span class="highlight highlight-main">for over 2 years, I helped stakeholders to validate their design problems, confirm use scenarios, rapidly prototype solutions with constraints, and deliver in a timely manner.</span>

                </h3>
                <p>
                Dance is an important part of my life. I started when I was like 7 years old, where schools would organize kids dance performances as an after-class activity. I've been an amateur dancer since then. I did Chinese traditional dance, contemporary, hip-hop, jazz, popping, and k-pop. The dance community is so inclusive and supportive, that I was able to meet many good buddies while enjoying the dance floor.  </p>
                <p>Ever since graduating from school, I practice mostly at home and the gym. <span class="highlight highlight-main">It's my cardio, my meditation, and my excuse for eating sinful food.</span> Feel free to check out some of my dance videos uploaded my <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWSlNp7y6uVMEJTYceXbaiw">YouTube Channel</a>. (Hope you don't mind how amateur they are.) If you are also interested in dance, hit me up!

            <p>
                <span class="highlight highlight-main">My motivation for going to the gym: being able to eat without constraint :) </span>I'm usually a very calm person unless I see and eat good food. Thanks to my family who often cooked with me when I was little, I'm able to "feed" myself pretty well when studying and working abroad. I enjoy cooking and eating all types of cuisine. Here's some looking-good & tasting-good food I've cooked: Souffl√© pancake with homemade matcha cream, lobster laksa noodles, Christmas tree crepes, salted egg yolk cake, avocado egg sandwiches & "wreath" salad.
