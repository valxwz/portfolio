                                A scene from a popular movie is powerful enough to catapult an otherwise unremarkable site into fame overnight.The most recent example comes thanks to"Joker". In one of its highlight moments, Joker dances down a stretch of steps. The stairs are a functional part of suburb NYC, but thanks to the movie, they’ve grown into a tourist phenomenon. When you do Google search, there's even a new tourist attraction generated called "Joker Stairs". </br>

                                "Joker" is not the only movie that brings so much foot traffic to one place. We could see the same impact from many other movies, drama, and music MVs. <span class="highlight highlight-cinetrip">However, not every film locations could be nicely marked on Google map.</span>

                                It took people huge effort to gather movie screenshots, search to figure out which film locations to worth a visit, and plan the trip to visit not only film locations but also other tourist attractions. Some film locations are in the middle of nowhere. You can't  just search a place name on Google Map. Sometimes when you finally arrived at the place, it's already closed, or you know you are at the right place but not sure what's the angel to take a photo.

                            There's no user-centered design without knowing users' need. We did some secondary research, hosted a participatory design workshop with travelers who visited film locations, and hosted an Airbnb movie walking tour to observe and gather user need. These research helped us to brainstorm and prioritize solutions.

                        After all the walking tour observations and user testing/interviews, I summarized all the insights and created the following personas to guide my design and our group discussion. </br> <span class="highlight highlight-cinetrip"> Why do we put "movie fan" as secondary user?</span> We realize that majority of people won't necessarily travel to a place only because of a movie. Most of them will visit film locations if they are "nearby" or "on the way".  Therefore, in order to target more users, in the MVP, we focus more on "instagram blogger" and " random travelers".

                        The primary goal of the first version is to help users aggregate filming location information, decide which place to go and enjoy visiting the places. We have more features ideas for future implementation to better sustain the app which however, are not essential at this time. We want to launch the app and test the market before committing to more features. Therefore, we created this MVP user flow to indicate core features and future implementations.

                        With the comments we had from initial lo-fi testing, I quickly iterated into mid-fi wireframes. I drew a few different versions for internal discussion and here's one example down below. I hosted 1-2 design critiques every week to quickly iterate based on comments I received.
