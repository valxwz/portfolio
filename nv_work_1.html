                    <p>The product I worked on is an internal ops tool used by warehouse staff. While it handles complex operational needs, it’s less visually “sexy”—my design goal was to clearly communicate what users need to do and provide direct, actionable feedback, rather than attract or onboard new users with polished aesthetics.

                        <p>Initially, the symptom stakeholders observed during their warehouse visit was that when staff scanned and onboarded shipments to a trip, the app displayed an alert: “The shipment you just scanned is an error.

                            <p>In middle mile operations, the label on a shipment shows its final destination. For the sake of operational efficiency, the driver typically <span class="highlight highlight-nv">delivers it to the next transit hub—not directly to the shipment's destination. </span> There may be multiple transit hubs along the route before the shipment reaches its final destination.</p>

                                We found that ground staff do check the shipment’s destination to decide whether it should be onboarded to a trip. Although the trip’s next stop is a transit hub—not the shipment’s final destination—<span class="highlight highlight-nv">they rely on memory of the shipment destination</span>–to–transit hub mapping to make that decision. It’s <span class="highlight highlight-nv">not hard for users to memorize the mapping</span> mainly because they work the <span class="highlight highlight-nv">same shifts and handle the same trips daily.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>The core of this problem lies in the <span class="highlight highlight-nv">mismatch between how the system believes shipments should travel and how they should move in reality</span>. The system calculates the path based on the shortest travel time to the final destination and assigns shipments to trips accordingly.</p>
                            <p>However, <span class="highlight highlight-nv">in reality, </span> regional trip planners determine the best route based on a combination of <span class="highlight highlight-nv">three factors:</span>1) Shortest travel time. 2) Fewest transit hubs, 3) Lowest van usage—where a single van can carry multiple shipments from the origin hub to various downstream hubs. It might not be the fastest route, but could be the cheapest.  </p>

                                            To understand what should happen versus what’s actually happening, I conducted <span class="highlight highlight-nv">staff interviews</span> across 🇮🇩 Indonesia, 🇲🇾 Malaysia, 🇵🇭 the Philippines, and 🇻🇳 Vietnam—regions with the highest volume of error shipments. I gathered <span class="highlight highlight-nv">video evidence</span> and <span class="highlight highlight-nv">visited the warehouse</span> in 🇲🇾 Malaysia, which handles the largest shipment volume. We discovered that ground staff rely on shipment destination codes to decide which shipments to onboard—something <span class="highlight highlight-nv">stakeholders were initially skeptical about.</span> To validate our insights, we ran a <span class="highlight highlight-nv">concept test</span> in the most error-prone regions using real shipment and trip data. Conducted in collaboration with engineers and stakeholders, the test revealed user behavior firsthand. After presenting our findings and recommendations, we aligned the entire team—turning early skepticism into full confidence.
