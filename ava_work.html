                                <a href="https://www.eatwithava.com/" target="_blank">Ava</a> is a health tech company whose application offers <span class="highlight highlight-ava">nutrition and coaching recommendations for weight loss and chronic conditions related to diet. </span>It follows a B2B2C model. Ava builds and sells the app and its services to business partners in the food and nutrition industry. The apps features stay relatively the same but with partner's branding.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ava has developed for 4 years and it has a relatively clear product vision - <span class="highlight highlight-ava"> a platform that can substitute expensive dietitian services. </span> It should be <span class="highlight highlight-ava">the Uber for dietitians and patients.</span> We offer a platform for patients and dietitians. Patients ask for help, and available dietitians come to take the request. Dietitians can see patients' previous record and coach patients to have a balanced life. To do so, Ava's app has 3 main features - track nutrition and activity status, meal plan and logging, dietitian coaching services.

                        <p>
                            During my 3 months at Ava, my work dabbled into all three features. Ava was initially designed by a design agency a long time ago. While business partners are interested in Ava's business model, they are not satisfied with the app product. It's buggy, hard to use, and outdated. My work is to understand business requests and user pain points. Togather with PM, we defined and prioritized problems based on their urgency and resources needed. <span class="highlight highlight-ava">I would then redesign or create from scratch. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall go over some main problems I tackled on. If you are interested to know my <span class="highlight highlight-ava">design rationals and iterations of each solution</span>, feel free to <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="contact-dialog">contact me </a> and I can walk you through.</p>

                                This meal-logging problem relates to the old design of the Daily Mealplan feature, as user log in food from the Mealplan page. <span class="highlight highlight-ava">But it's very time-consuming to change the whole Daily Mealplan feature.

To minimize the number of clicks, we auto-select meal type based on the time of the food-logging event. For example, if users log-in before 11am, we auto select type Breakfast. It's not the most ideal solution but given the current Daily Mealplan main page We want to give them the flexibility to choose accurate items, units and quantity, but also not to overwhelm them with too many options.

            Influenced Product Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                My first task with Ava is <span class="highlight highlight-ava">redesigning the Home/Dashboard page.</span> It was initially designed by a design agency long time ago. Stakeholders felt the design is outdated and off. They didn't mention specific concerns but want me to explore and redesign. </p>
                <p>
                    I went through understanding the product vision, validating problems. <span class="highlight highlight-ava">I realized the key problem we had was that there's a gap between what we think is best for users and what users want to know.</span> For example, we used to repeat the same health information and hope users could read all of them and not miss any. The reality was that users have a clear goal in mind when they came to the app - they want to know the weight track and don't care about sleep hours, regardless of how many times we tell them "here you can check your sleep hours". <span class="highlight highlight-ava">The goal of the app was to offer all information with certain prioritization so that users can quickly found their interested information, and dive deeper if they want to.</span> I communicated this goal with PMs and CEO, with some potential redesign solutions. <span class="highlight highlight-ava"> They agreed with the goal I mentioned and committed to the new product strategy - think about what users urgently want to know and need to do, assuming they only use the app for 1 min.</span> In the end, the new design surfaced information that was thoughtfully prioritized and categorized.

                    After auditing the old design, I summarized problems of the current design and prepared alternatives I was thinking. I made the meeting more like a co-design workshop - I came with some prepared suggestions as a start point of our discussion, and we'll finalize solutions together.

                Since Ava's product was designed by several design agencies in response to different business partner's requests, <span class="highlight highlight-ava">the app is full of different design patterns.</span> Features are launched in different phases and developers just grab whatever is handy. Therefore, after finishing a few urgent requests, <span class="highlight highlight-ava">I started defining an unified design pattern. </span>

            Achieve Ideal Design in Phases

            <p>
                I was aware of the speed we were moving and the limited resources we had, but I want to open up to design opportunities that can deliver the best user experience and bring the most profit. Therefore, <span class="highlight highlight-ava">I always brought several design alternatives to the table </span> - the ideal version and the quick & nasty approaches, to discuss with devs and PM. In such a case, the team was able to find a middle ground or launch the ideal design into phases.

                    Since Ava is moving fast, the business request sometimes could come spontaneously and direct a designer with a certain solution in mind. It's my responsibility to take the request, think if it's a valid problem and approach, and either finalize the solution or push back the request. It's a subtle art of communicating your disagreement. I like to discuss in a way of we are on the same side. I'm not opposing you. I'm trying to discuss if there's a better way of achieving the same goal. <span class="highlight highlight-ava">Adding a "wdyt?" often opens the discussion.</span>
