                                            Users can quickly log-in meals, snacks, and supplements throughout the day. To minimize the number of clicks, we auto-select meal type based on the time of the food-logging event. For example, if users log-in before 11am, we auto select type Breakfast. It's not the most ideal solution but given the current Daily Mealplan main page We want to give them the flexibility to choose accurate items, units and quantity, but also not to overwhelm them with too many options.

                        My first task with Ava is <span class="highlight highlight-ava">redesigning the Home/Dashboard page.</span> It was initially designed by a design agency long time ago.

                        <p>
                            I went through understanding the product vision, validating problems, iterating solutions and quickly reach to a deliverable design. The new design surfaced information that was thoughtfully prioritized and categorized. <span class="highlight highlight-ava">It led stakeholders to think about what users urgently want and also need to know and do, assuming they only use the app for 1 min.</span>

                            After auditing the old design, I summarized problems of the current design and prepared alternatives I was thinking. I made the meeting more like a co-design workshop - I came with some prepared suggestions as a start point of our discussion, and we'll finalize solutions together.

                        I was aware of the speed we were moving and the limited resources we had, but I want to open up to design opportunities that can deliver the best user experience and bring the most profit. Therefore, <span class="highlight highlight-ava">I always brought several design alternatives to the table </span> - the ideal version and the quick & nasty approaches, to discuss with devs and PM. In such a case, the team was able to find a middle ground or launch the ideal design into phases.

                            Since Ava is moving fast, the business request sometimes could come spontaneously and direct a designer with a certain solution in mind. It's my responsibility to take the request, think if it's a valid problem and approach, and either finalize the solution or push back the request. It's a subtle art of communicating your disagreement. I like to discuss in a way of we are on the same side. I'm not opposing you. I'm trying to discuss if there's a better way of achieving the same goal. <span class="highlight highlight-ava">Adding a "wdyt?" often opens the discussion.</span>
